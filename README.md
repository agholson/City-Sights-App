# City Sights App
This app displays the best restaurants near the current user based on the https://codewithchris.com iOS Foundations module 6.

It interacts with the Yelp API, as well as the CoreLocation framework to grab the user's location.

# Getting User Location
Add to the pslist, or the Info target tab a new key explaining the use of this information:
`Privacy - Location When In use ...`
